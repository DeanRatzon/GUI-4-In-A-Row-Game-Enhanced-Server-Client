A trivia question writing format:<br>
1st line - question<br>
2nd line - correct answer<br>
3rd line - answer option<br>
4th line - answer option<br>
5th line - answer option<br>

For example:<br>
What is 1+1?<br>
2<br>
1<br>
4<br>
3<br>

Please note:<br>
*Each question should have excatly 4 answers options.<br>
*Different questions should have a single empty line inbetween them. <br>
*When a question loads, the answers will be positioned randomly (in different locations every time) so dont worry about writing the correct answer first everytime.<br>
*Please Make sure to run the runServer.bat (and keep it open) before running the runClient.bat <br>
*You can open multiple clients at once and play them simultaneously/.<br>
